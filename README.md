Home Credit Risk Portfolio

Business Problem Statement: Home Credit needs a homogenous strategy to compile alternative data to confirm prospective clients capable of loan repayments are not rejected. Home Credit uses telco and transactional data to predict the loan repayment abilities. Our analytics approach would be to use the full potential of the alternative data to see whether or not an applicant will be able to pay back a loan.
  Home Credit wants to empower customers by enabling them to borrow easily and safely. With a solution, the business will have an increase in clientâ€™s and in turn provide more revenue for Home Credit. The scope of the project is to identify the potential defaulters based on exploratory data analysis with the data given about the applicants features. Success metrics will be defined by a larger circle of prospective clients being accepted that are capable of making loan repayments. My team consists of myself, Jenisha Rawal, Tarun Gulati, and Anjan Kumar. The project will be finished by August 2nd and we will present to the stakeholders that day. Important project milestones to keep in mind would be to complete our exploratory data analysis notebook by June 18th and modeling by July 9th.

Solution: My groups solution to the problem was to believe the current model is useful and will help Home Credit significantly in its expansion endeavors. Nevertheless, there are ample opportunities to improve the model as Home Credit needs become more complicated. Additional sources of data such as the history of payment should be used to improve the accuracy rate. Moreover, for now, we are only considering yes/no for the default rate without taking the loan amount into consideration. Different models should be created for different loan types to avoid losses and to maximize profits in Home Credit expansion. It is very likely that the highly different nature of revolving loans and cash loans makes for different optimal models.
Business Value of Solution: With this solution, it provides value to the business by allowing Home Credit Risk to look at all aspects of the potential default risk of a customer so they don't turn away potential profits. This will therefore increase their revenue and expand their business.

Projects:

Exploratory Data Analysis: relationship between target and predictors through use of visualizations and data cleaning

Modeling: use of cross validation, peformance benchmarks, random forest and gradient boosting, upsampling and downsampling, and additional feature engineering to boost model performance

Presentation

Difficulties: Some difficulties we had were when we were modeling the different tasks and making sure that all the varaiables were the same across the board. The other problem we faced was how we dealt with NA's.
Learning Experience: Overall, this was a great learning experience because I got to experience first hand of analyzing a project from start to finish. I got to see the nuances that would prehibit further movement in a project and troublshoot on how to get out of the situation. This class allowed me to apply my analytical skills to business understandings, which will help with our next sponsor workshop.
